# Caesar Cipher

A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters during encryption and decryption.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/caesar-cipher.git
   cd caesar-cipher
